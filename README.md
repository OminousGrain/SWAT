S.W.A.T (Security &amp; Web Attack Tool) is a reconnaissance multi-tool for Security/Pentesting written in Python3.As of now it features a PScan(PortScanner), H2IP(Host to IP), Scarab(Web Scrapper). The tool is FAR from being finished, but as time progresses and my skills improve the tool will be expanded upon.
